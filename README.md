The algorithm is based on a finite convex polygon set representation of objects, where path planning is built upon a Lipschitz continuous artificial potential field. In trajectory planning, constraints on current and voltage are incorporated, and time-optimal trajectories are derived using the Augmented Lagrangian method and the L-BFGS optimization algorithm.
